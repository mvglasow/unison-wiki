This page contains feature requests that are unlikely to ever be implemented, for various reasons:
  - The benefit of the feature does not clearly outweigh the complexity.
  - The feature addresses a problem very few have.

Features are somewhat organized, and many are just links to closed enhancement tickets.  The point is to move the issue tracker towards having actionable items, and to organize the unlikely-to-ever-happen requests.
