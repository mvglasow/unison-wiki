This page contains feature requests that are unlikely to ever be implemented, for various reasons:
  - The benefit of the feature does not clearly outweigh the complexity.
  - The feature addresses a problem very few have.

Features are somewhat organized, and many are just links to closed enhancement tickets.  The point is to move the issue tracker towards having actionable items, and to organize the unlikely-to-ever-happen requests.

# Increased Granularity

  - [Allow excluding all subdirectories, leaving only files in the root](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/981)                                                                                                                                   

# User niceties

  - [Configure cleanup interval for tmp files](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/837)
  - [Show progress in GUI when using external rsync](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/549)
  - [Enable directory renaming within a root](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/477)
  - [Tweak GUI tooltip strategy](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/169)
  - [Renaming of roots](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/1023)

# Non-portable efficiency improvements

  - [Use NTFS's USN for change detection](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/209)

# Things that might be valid and might be fixed already

  - [Allow sorting by all columns in the GUI](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/17)

# Issues not clearly understood

These are issues that belong on unison-hackers rather than the tracker (following the rule that only fully-thought-out enhancement requests belong in the tracker).

  - [Store backups only on server](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/268)
