# Unison Mailing Lists

There are two mailing lists for unison, for general user discussion, and for development discussion.   There is no intent to exclude anyone from the developers list; the point is to allow people who don't want those messages to not get them.

Note also that the github issue tracker is strictly for bugs and feature requests.  Questions are off topic and issues that are questions will be summarily closed.  If you think there might be a bug and you aren't sure, please ask on unison-hackers if your theory involves reading code, and either on unison-hackers or unison-users if your theory doesn't involve code references.
