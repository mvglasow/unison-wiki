# Unison Mailing Lists

There are two mailing lists for unison, for general user discussion, and for development discussion.   There is no intent to exclude anyone from the developers list; the point is to allow people who don't want those messages to not get them.

Note also that the github issue tracker is strictly for bugs and feature requests.  Questions are off topic and issues that are questions will be summarily closed.

## unison-users

unison-users is a higher-volume discussion forum for users of unison. It is used for discussions of many sorts --- proposals and designs for new features, installation and configuration questions, usage tips, etc. It is moderated to filter spam.

## unison-hackers

unison-hackers is for informal discussion among people seeking to improve Unison.  Anyone who wishes to lend a hand with maintaining and improving Unison is welcome to join.  Only members can post.

unison-hackers is a mailman list.  To subscribe, see http://lists.seas.upenn.edu/mailman/listinfo/unison-hackers
