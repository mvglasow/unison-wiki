## Binaries

The project builds binaries as part of CI and a number of them are available on the releases page at https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/releases

It is not clear how portable any of these are, in terms of which systems they will run on.

Pointers to community-built binaries are at [Community-Binaries](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/wiki/Community-Binaries).
